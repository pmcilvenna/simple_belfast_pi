-- PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS APPLIED:
-- 
-- 1. **CTE Structure**: Broke down into logical CTEs for better query plan optimization
-- 2. **Constants CTE**: Pre-calculate the delayed cutoff timestamp once
-- 3. **Filtered Supply Tags CTE**: Separate the subquery to allow better join optimization
-- 4. **IFF vs CASE**: Used Snowflake's optimized IFF function instead of CASE statements
-- 5. **Removed IN clauses**: Converted single-value IN clauses to equality comparisons
-- 6. **Date Range Optimization**: Changed <= to < for better index utilization
-- 7. **Explicit Type Casting**: Added ::STRING and ::timestamp for clearer data types
-- 8. **DATE() Function**: Used DATE() instead of date_trunc('day') for day-level grouping
-- 9. **Cross Join Constants**: Avoid repeated function calls in WHERE clauses
-- 10. **Reduced Redundancy**: Pre-calculate whiteops_blocked_total once
-- 11. **Simplified Timezone**: Removed redundant UTC to UTC timezone conversion
-- 12. **Column Aliasing**: Cleaner column references in final SELECT

-- ADDITIONAL SNOWFLAKE-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
-- 
-- 1. **Clustering**: Consider clustering the supply_full_aggregations table on (account_id, ymdh)
-- 2. **Materialized Views**: If this query runs frequently, consider a materialized view
-- 3. **Result Caching**: Enable result caching for repeated identical queries
-- 4. **Warehouse Sizing**: Use appropriate warehouse size based on data volume
-- 5. **Query Tags**: Add query tags for monitoring: ALTER SESSION SET QUERY_TAG = 'supply_fraud_analysis';
